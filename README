This is my .vim folder and includes my .vimrc.

I have ~/.vimrc as a symlink to ~/.vim/vimrc so that I can keep
both in version control.

All files licensed as per details in the files themselves.

Notably, this setup has 8 spaces for hard tabs, 4 for the default soft tabs
and uses 2 for ruby files. Makefiles are set to use hard tabs.
The default theme is zenburn. There are some awesome plugins.

You should run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` after cloning to
pull in submodule plugins.
